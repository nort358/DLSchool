Practical tasks of Deep Learning School

HotDogOrNot is a task of binary classification resolved with ResNet18 with pictures being augmented. It uses firstly pre-trained model and then applies transfer learning and fine-tuning for getting better quality on test dataset. It got 0.93 F1-score

A task of Stanfor Housenumbers is multi classificational one firstly resolved with the fully-connected neural network on Pytorch framework. Notebook uses tensorboard for tracking and visualizing training and some features of ClearML.

The second iteration of Stanfor Housenumbers task is being resolved with a convolutional neural network
